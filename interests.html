    <h2>Things That Inspire Me</h2>

    <p>
      Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by computers and how they work.
       Over time, this curiosity grew into a strong passion for technology,
        especially in the field of web development. I enjoy exploring how websites are built, 
        how they function, and how users interact with them. </p>
        <p>
        The idea of creating something that people from all around the world can use and benefit
         from motivates me to learn more every day.

        My interest in the web goes beyond just design;
         I like to understand both the front-end and the back-end, because I believe that every detail matters.
          On the front-end, I enjoy working with layouts, styles, and responsive designs that make websites
           look modern and professional. On the back-end, I am interested in logic, 
           databases, and security, which help websites run smoothly and safely.</p>

          <p>Computers, in general, are a world full of opportunities for me.
             I see them as tools that can solve problems, connect people, and even change lives. 
             That is why I dedicate a lot of time to learning new programming languages, practicing my coding skills, 
             and keeping up with the latest technologies. I believe that by mastering both computers and web development,
              I will be able to create powerful solutions, open new doors, and build a strong career in the future.
